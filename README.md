# image_format_converter
Small project I am doing to learn Rust.

Assuming you have Rust and Cargo installed, simply do `cargo run` while in the top level of the project.

There is also an executable in the project: `target/release/image_proc`
run `./image_proc` (assuming you are in the executable's parent folder) to try the program that way. I would recommend providing the full path to the image if done this way.

This project is about 80% done. There are some things to iron out for quality, and I would like to make a proper executable with CLI args.
